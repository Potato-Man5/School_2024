    <p>During today's TLE session of 9/12/2024</p>
    <br>
    <p>As we all know me, Jaz, McVernon and aswell as you Sir Jason we tried to fix Henry's code. We did all of sorts of
        things in an attempt to fix it, all the way from Double-Checking to more Quadruple-Checking, copying code, sending
        code to each other, debugging so much painful minutes wasted on this one problem  but it still wasn't enough to fix.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        So I told Henry to email me the code so that I can debug it at home with Visual Studio Code or maybe even ask help 
        from Mr. Chat GPT. When I finally got home I booted up my laptop and opened up the code and VSH to try and see what
        the problem with the code is. I tried many things from seeing if maybe the function name was wrong to removing and adding
        and readded to code but it still wasnt working so I finally asked the assistance of Chat GPT and apparently the 
        quotation marks of the various things such as the "id" part on the "p" tag was not matching with others, so after an hour
        of debugging code, doing everything we can at school the entire root cause of the problem was not the code itself nor the
        syntax but it was the <i>QUOTATION MARKS</i>, the <i>QUOTE MARKS</i>. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I knew the problem was something about the computer and not the 
        code itself. It was the keyboard's fault for giving the wrong type of QUOTE MARKS aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa <i>*American 
        Screaming*</i>. I CAN'T BELIEVE THE CAUSE OF ALL OF THIS WAS THE QUOTE MARKS OF ALL THINGS. Hahahahaha so I guess we now dont
        only have to <strong>triple check the tags</strong>, and <strong>syntax</strong> but also the <mark><b>SYMBOLS WE 
        USE</b></mark>. In conclusion as I learn right now with this situtation/problem that was a bit ridiculous I have
        learned that coding has its ups and downs but in the end learning what the problem was is kinda 
        funny and its rewarding to fix it, so just keep coding and have fun with it and I am once again finding the fun of
        coding again after 2 months hiatus due to summer break. I'm excited to learn more about programming this subject 
        and I hope that we will have one of the best years as the last year of high more and this being possibly my last year
        here in St. Paul after a very long 12 years of me being here since kinder. You (Sir. Jason) and Ms. MR are definetly 
        great teachers when it comes to programming.
